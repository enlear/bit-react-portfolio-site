import { History } from "./history";

The entity component creates an in-memory representation of a work experience item.

## Live Playground

Change the values in the history object to see it render in live.

```tsx live
() => {
  const workItem = new History({
    designation: "Software Engineer",
    company: "Google",
    yearsOfExperience: 3,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {workItem.designation} | {workItem.company} | {workItem.yearsOfExperience}
    </div>
  );
};
```
