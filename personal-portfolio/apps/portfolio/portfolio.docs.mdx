Configure the app plugin on your workspace:

```bash
bit use apps/portfolio
```

### Run the application

You can run your application on a separate port to see it outside of the Bit workspace

```bash
bit run portfolio
```

### Deploying the application

The application is currently configured to be deployed with the Netlifyer Deployer.

```
const netlifyConfig = {
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN,
  stagingSiteName: 'portfolio-showoff-staging',
  productionSiteName: 'portfolio-showoff-production',
  team: 'enlear',
  redirects: '_redirects',
  webpackTransformers: [
    splitChunks,
    (config, context) => addSitemap(config, context, [...prerenderRoutes]),
  ],
};

```

Therefore, when you are deploying, ensure that you have added the `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` as an `env` var using the command `export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=<<YOUR-TOKEN>>`.
Hereafter, run `bit tag` to deploy the application.
